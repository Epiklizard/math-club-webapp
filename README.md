# math-club-webapp
Highschool version of Mathletics, designed for fast-paced maths with VCE concepts. Expandable to other topics. The website implements Express and Socket.io for real-time backend, MyScript handwritting recognision and MathJax for math input and display.
There are two files that this repo is going into details, server.js and client_page.html. The server.js is for management of questions from a JSON file and distribute them to the clients for display. The client_page.html is to recieve questions emitted from the server and emit data (user inputs) back to the server.
